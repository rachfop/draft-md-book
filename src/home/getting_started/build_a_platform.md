# Build a platform

Platform Engineers build their Internal Developer Platforms (IDP) by leveraging the Humanitec Platform Orchestrator and Score.

## Why build an Internal Developer Platform with Humanitec?

Humanitec provides a platform-agnostic Workload specification called Score. Score eliminates configuration management between local and remote environments. Meaning, developers can deploy their applications to any environment without having to change their configuration.

The Humanitec Platform Orchestrator works as a deployment engine that enables platform teams to build golden paths for developers. This means that platform teams can build a self-service model for developers to deploy their applications to the cloud and developers can deploy their applications without having to wait for the platform team to do it for them.

## What does the Platform look like?

We offer multiple ways to work with the Humanitec Platform Orchestator.


You can use the Humanitec Platform Orchestrator UI, API, or CLI to manage your applications, environments, deployments, and more.

In somecases, a Terraform provider is also available.
