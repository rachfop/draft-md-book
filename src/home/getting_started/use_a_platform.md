# Use a platform

Developers use Score to deploy their applications to their Internal Developer Platform.
The Humanitec Platform Orchestrator then takes care of the rest.

## Why use an Internal Developer Platform?

Internal Developer Platforms (IDP) enable developers to deploy their applications to the cloud without having to wait for the Platform Engineering team to do it for them.

Developers can deploy their applications to the cloud using the Humanitec Platform Orchestrator without having to know the underlying infrastructure.

This helps speed up development and deployment cycles and enables developers to focus on what they do best: writing code.

## What does the platform look like?

The Humanitec Platform Orchestrator is a cloud-native application that runs on Kubernetes.

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that enables developers to deploy their applications to the cloud and nortiously difficult to manage.

With Score and the Humanitec Platform Orchestrator, you can deploy your applications with a `git push` and allow your Platform Engineering team to manage the underlying infrastructure.

## How does it work?

Score simplifies the management of infrastructure, by relying on _dynamic configuration management_.

With Score, declare your resources, such as databases, queues, and caches, as abstract requests, known as _workload specifications_ and the Humanitec Platform Orchestrator will generate the configuration for you.

## Next steps?

Your Platform Engineering team should have already built a platform with the Humanitec Platform Orchestrator.

Get access to your team's organization and start deploying your applications to the cloud.
